#### &#x20;Plastics production worldwide

* On the one hand we are changing the use of fossil fuels to renewable energies, sunlight, hydrogen and electricity, but on the other hand the amount of carbon-based waste that we generate unbalances the balance again and as we increase in population we continue to generate waste even more exponentially.

#### World Poverty 1990

* Did you know that between the 80's and 90's countries like South Korea, Chile, Brazil, Mexico, Algeria, were among the poorest in the world. These and some others managed to have exponential growth due to different factors, which opened up opportunities, managing to create world-renowned companies.
* Education in early stages is a neuralgic point for the development of countries and for the opening of opportunities globally.
